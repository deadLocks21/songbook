/// Fans out every log record to a list of [LoggerService]s.
///
/// Primary use case: in debug builds that have a Signoz key configured,
/// wrap both the [ConsoleLoggerService] and the [SignozLoggerService] so
/// the developer sees in their console *exactly* what is shipped over
/// the network. Removes the gap between "what I see locally" and "what
/// lands in Signoz".
///
/// Calls into the children are sequential (`await` each) — the volume
/// is low enough that fan-out parallelism would be premature, and
/// sequential calls make the order in the console deterministic.
///
/// If a child throws (which it shouldn't per [LoggerService] contract,
/// but defensively), the error is swallowed so a faulty adapter cannot
/// take the others down.
